# Expo Managed Workflow iOS Build Crash Post-Update

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered in an Expo managed workflow application.  After upgrading to a newer Expo SDK version, the iOS build began crashing with unhelpful error messages in the Xcode console. The Android build remained unaffected.

## Bug Description

The application, built using Expo's managed workflow, crashed on iOS devices following an update.  Xcode provided generic error messages, making debugging extremely difficult. No code changes directly related to the crash were made.  The Android version of the app continued to work flawlessly.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Attempt to build the project for iOS using `expo build:ios`.
4. Observe the crash and the unhelpful error messages in Xcode.

## Solution

The solution involved investigating the Expo release notes and forums, looking for known issues related to this version update and any potential breaking changes to third-party libraries.  This example demonstrates the most likely scenario: A missing or outdated native module dependency.  After adding the necessary module and rebuild, the issue was resolved.
