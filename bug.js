While building an Expo managed workflow app, I encountered an issue where the app crashed on iOS devices after upgrading to a newer version of Expo. The error messages in the Xcode console were unhelpful, showing only generic exceptions.  The Android build worked without any issues. The code itself did not change significantly between versions, focusing primarily on UI updates using React Native components.
